## Understanding Results

### Sentiment Classifications

#### 5-Class System Explained
1. **Very Negative** (0.0-0.2): Strong negative sentiment
   - Examples: "Terrible", "Awful", "Hate it"
   
2. **Negative** (0.2-0.4): Moderate negative sentiment
   - Examples: "Disappointing", "Not good", "Poor quality"
   
3. **Neutral** (0.4-0.6): Balanced or no clear sentiment
   - Examples: "It's okay", "Average", "No opinion"
   
4. **Positive** (0.6-0.8): Moderate positive sentiment
   - Examples: "Good", "Satisfied", "Recommend"
   
5. **Very Positive** (0.8-1.0): Strong positive sentiment
   - Examples: "Excellent", "Amazing", "Love it"

### Confidence Scores

#### What They Mean
- **High Confidence (>0.8)**: Model is very certain about the classification
- **Medium Confidence (0.6-0.8)**: Model is reasonably confident
- **Low Confidence (<0.6)**: Model is uncertain, manual review suggested

#### Factors Affecting Confidence
- **Text Length**: Very short or very long texts may have lower confidence
- **Language Complexity**: Technical or ambiguous language reduces confidence
- **Mixed Sentiment**: Texts with both positive and negative elements
- **Sarcasm/Irony**: Difficult for models to detect

### Keyword Extraction

#### How It Works
- **KeyBERT Algorithm**: Identifies semantically important terms
- **Sentiment Context**: Highlights words that drive sentiment
- **Frequency Weighting**: More important words appear more prominently

#### Interpreting Keywords
- **Size**: Larger keywords are more important
- **Color**: May indicate sentiment association
- **Relevance**: Keywords should relate to the main sentiment drivers

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How accurate is the sentiment analysis?**  
A: The system achieves 84% accuracy on benchmark datasets. Accuracy varies by text type and complexity.

**Q: Can I use this for languages other than English?**  
A: The current model is optimized for English. Limited support for other languages may work but with reduced accuracy.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes, all processing happens locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers.

**Q: How many texts can I process at once?**  
A: The system supports up to 10,000 texts per batch, though smaller batches (50-500) process faster.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why are some confidence scores low?**  
A: Low confidence typically indicates ambiguous text, mixed sentiment, or content outside the model's training domain.

**Q: Can I customize the sentiment categories?**  
A: The current version uses a fixed 5-class system. Customization requires code modifications.

**Q: How long does processing take?**  
A: Single texts: <2 seconds. Batch processing: 0.1-0.5 seconds per text depending on system performance.

**Q: What happens if the analysis fails?**  
A: The system includes error handling to gracefully manage failures and provide informative error messages.

### Usage Questions

**Q: What's the best file format for batch analysis?**  
A: CSV is recommended for structured data with multiple columns. TXT works well for simple text lists.

**Q: Can I analyze social media posts?**  
A: Yes, the model is specifically trained on social media content and performs well on tweets, posts, and comments.

**Q: How do I interpret mixed sentiment results?**  
A: Mixed sentiment often appears as "Neutral" with moderate confidence. Review keywords to understand the balance.

**Q: Can I save my analysis sessions?**  
A: Currently, sessions are temporary. Use the export features to save results permanently.
